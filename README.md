# 🌦️ Weather Data Analysis using Python

## 📌 Project Overview

This project focuses on **exploratory data analysis (EDA) of a weather dataset** using **Python** to uncover patterns, trends, and relationships between different meteorological parameters. The analysis demonstrates how raw environmental data can be transformed into meaningful insights using data analytics techniques.

The project is implemented entirely in a **Jupyter Notebook**, making it easy to understand, reproduce, and extend.

## 🧩 Problem Statement

Weather data contains multiple variables such as temperature, humidity, wind speed, visibility, and atmospheric conditions. Analyzing this data manually is inefficient. This project aims to:

* Understand weather trends and conditions through statistical analysis
* Identify relationships between key weather parameters
* Practice real-world data analysis using Python libraries

---
