# 📊 Zepto Sales & Performance Analysis (Power BI)

## 📌 Project Overview

This project presents an end-to-end **sales and performance analysis of Zepto**, a 10-minute grocery delivery platform, using **Power BI**. The objective is to extract meaningful business insights from raw sales data and represent them through an interactive and decision-focused dashboard.

The analysis focuses on understanding **sales trends, item category performance, outlet location impact, ratings, and customer preferences**, enabling data-driven business decisions.

## 🧩 Problem Statement

Zepto operates across multiple outlet locations with a wide range of product categories. Analyzing large-scale transactional data manually is inefficient and error-prone. This project aims to:

* Identify high-performing item categories and outlet locations
* Track key performance indicators (KPIs) such as average sales, ratings, and item demand
* Support strategic decisions related to inventory planning and outlet optimization

## 📂 Dataset Information

* **Source**: Excel dataset (included in the repository)
* **Data Type**: Structured retail sales data
* **Key Features**:

  * Item Type & Item Identifier
  * Outlet Location Type
  * Sales Amount
  * Item Ratings
  * Item Attributes (e.g., fat content, weight)

---

## 🛠️ Tools & Technologies Used

* **Power BI** – Data visualization and dashboard creation
* **Power Query** – Data cleaning and transformation
* **DAX (Data Analysis Expressions)** – KPI calculations and measures
* **Microsoft Excel** – Source data handling

---

## 🔄 Data Processing Workflow

1. Imported raw Excel data into Power BI
2. Cleaned and standardized inconsistent values (missing data, text normalization)
3. Transformed data using Power Query Editor
